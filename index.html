        <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
        <p>The issue of website phishing is a major security concern in the digital era. Phishing involves deceptive attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity in digital communication.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Does This Project Matter?</h2>
        <p>A Forbes report noted that in 2022, the United States faced over 500 million phishing attacks, affecting more than 300,000 people and resulting in financial losses exceeding $52 million.</p>
        
        <h2>The Risk in Everyday Transactions</h2>
        <p>Online activities like shopping on platforms like Amazon and using credit cards daily can expose users to vulnerabilities, especially the elderly who may struggle with verifying the authenticity of websites.</p>
        
        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>To combat phishing, this project aims to create a machine learning model trained to recognize key characteristics of authentic websites, thus identifying sites as phishing, suspicious, or legitimate.</p>

        <p>Hello! My name is Sharon Mega. I am a senior majoring in Data Science and 
            double minoring in Mathematics and African and African American Studies. 
            I have recently developed a passion for cybersecurity and data security 
            hence my decision to do this project. Welcome to my journey, 
            if you want to see other projects I've done, 
            here is a link to
             my <a href="https://github.com/SharonM73/DSC_500-Poster-Presentation"
